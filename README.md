Flatiron Sintra Project Assessment - Show Me The Money - Your All Stars Selections

Show Me The Money is a rap competition television show in South Korea where contestants go head to head in a series of challenges until only one artist remains. The show (SMTM) first aired in 2012 and has 9 seasons. This web app allows users to create a fantasy All Star lineup (4 rounds/4 individual artists) of the show using past winners, runner-ups, and any self created profiles. Who would you like to see take on South Korea's greatest Hip Hop stars?

This project is not directly related to Show Me The Money or its network.
